                  </h4>


                  <p class="research__descrition">
                    The way energy powers all life on earth is undeniable, but the use of nonrenewable
                    energy sources has resulted in a significant environmental impact due to the residue it leaves
                    behind. Nowadays, the combustion of oil, coal, and natural gas produces more than 85% of the
                    total power used worldwide (Dudin et al., 2019). When fossil fuels are burned, a certain amount
                    of residue is left behind in the form of solids and gasses (e.g. nitrogen oxides, coal ash, fly ash,
                    bottom ash). Further, fossil fuel residue can not be recycled, which leads to environmental
                    pollution. With this, we should seek more alternative energy sources, including renewable
                    resources. Moreover, resources that can generate energy continually without worrying about
                    diminishing in the short or medium term are known as renewable resources. Examples of
                    renewable energy are solar, biomass, geothermal, wind, and hydroelectric energy (Güney, 2019).
                    In addition, bioenergy is a natural alternative to producing energy. Therefore, bioenergy can be
                    used to generate electricity using organic waste such as food waste.
                    
                    <br /><br />
                    Food waste is a type of municipal solid waste (MSW) that is becoming more widely
                    recognized (Chen et al., 2023). According to the Department of Science and Technology’s Food
                    Banana and Nutrition Institute (DOST-FNRI), the Philippines produce 1,717 metric tons of food
                    waste daily. Frequently, food waste is being disposed of in landfills. This explains why a
                    significant amount of fugitive greenhouse gas (GHG) is being emitted due to food waste having
                    the largest methane potential (Badgett and Milbrandt, 2021). Finding a sustainable method of
                    disposing of food waste is absolutely necessary, as sending food waste to landfills is neither
                    financially viable nor ecologically responsible.
                    
                    <br /><br />
                    Due to the depletion of fossil resources and worries about climate change, people are
                    growing more interested in renewable energy (Mohammadi et al., 2021). With this, the
                    implementation of food waste-to-energy is something that would be very beneficial for society as
                    a whole. In addition, food waste has great potential for generating energy. Rojas-Flores et al.
                    (2020) provided information on fruit wastes that can be used as renewable energy and an
                    alternative method for producing electricity called microbial fuel cells (MFC). Caruso et al.
                    (2019) stated insights on using biogas from food waste to generate renewable energy. Breunig et
                    al. (2017) estimated that California's food waste can generate 530 Megawatts of electricity.
                    Finally, Kalagbor et al. (2020) provided information on electricity generation from discarded
                    tomatoes, bananas, pineapple fruits, and peels.
                    
                    <br /><br />
                    According to previous studies, it was recommended to use tomatoes and bananas since
                    tomatoes contain redox-active molecules, specifically carotenoids and flavonoids, and their
                    natural lycopene can encourage the generation of electricity. Tomatoes also have high
                    conductivity, and the quercetin in them may exhibit electrochemical activity in an aqueous
                    medium(Fogg et al., 2015). In addition, bananas are available all year round, and they are rich in
                    carbohydrates and other essential nutrients that can enhance microbial growth. Banana biomass,
                    including both fruit and peels, has been used to produce methane gas and biofuels, and banana
                    peels in particular have been shown to result in higher rates of methane production compared to
                    other fruit wastes (Essien et al., 2005). By utilizing these fruit wastes, which are typically
                    discarded and can have negative impacts on the environment and health, bio-energy can be
                    produced through microbial fuel cells.

                    <br /><br />
                    Similarly, sweet potato waste was used in this research. The skin peels of sweet potatoes
                    are a vital source of fermentable sugars which is a potential source for bioethanol production
                    (Bhuvaneswari & Sivakumar, 2019).

                    <br /><br />
                    The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using microbial fuel cells (MFCs) to
                    generate electricity from various types of fruit and vegetable waste. The study also intended to
                    investigate the potential use of MFCs in providing electricity to the Sitio Makabuhay community.
                    The study also identified if weight has an effect on the amount of voltage and current to be
                    produced. Ultimately, the goal was to promote sustainable energy generation by utilizing fruit
                    and vegetable waste as a renewable energy source.

                    <p class="about__description">
                        The study adopted a quantitative research approach, employing a true experimental
                        design to systematically investigate the impact of both weight and the type of plant on the
                        generation of voltage and amperage. Over a span of four days, continuous readings of voltage
                        and amperage were collected. Notably, the voltage data exhibited a normal distribution,
                        validating the use of a Two-Way ANOVA to discern the effects of weight and plant type. In
                        contrast, the amperage data did not conform to a normal distribution, leading to the application
                        of the Kruskal-Wallis test—a non-parametric alternative—to effectively analyze the given
                        dataset.
